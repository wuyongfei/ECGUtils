ECG-FM is a foundation model for electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. Committed to open-source practices, 
ECG-FM was developed in collaboration with the fairseq_signals framework, which implements a collection 
of deep learning methods for ECG analysis. This repository serves as a landing page and will host 
project-specific scripts as this work progresses.

C# ECG Toolkit is another free software to view the recorded ECG files. It is a very useful software 
which supports multiple recorded ECG file formats. These ECG formats include aECG File (.xml), 
DICOM File (.dcm), ISHNE File (.ecg), MUSE-XML File (.xml), OmronECG File (.ecg), 
and SCP-ECG File (.scp).

General features of this free ECG viewer software:
You can change the background color.
You can change the grid color and pattern.
It lets you change the color, width, and style (ECG to be displayed as a solid line or dotted one) of the ECG pattern.
You can also add comments to the patient’s ECG report.
The ECG graph can be saved in JPG, PDF, DCM, and EKG formats.


Since 2005, the FDA only accepts submissions of annotated ECG waveform data in electronic format (XML). This stipulation complies with the Health Level Seven (HL7) Annotated ECG Waveform Data Standard (aECG) accredited by the American National Standards Institute.

AMPS provides a service converting digital ECG traces of various formats into digital FDA-compliant format XML files. This services is an ideal solution for Core Labs and Sponsors that need to rapidly and efficiently convert large number of ECGs before the submission to the FDA Warehouse.

How to use the Service

ECG file formats accepted as input include: Mortara XML (E-Scribe & H-Scribe), GE MUSE XML (Transactional XML), Philips XML (Sierra XML), Schiller XML, AMPS binary ECG, ISHNE, SCP, and MIT.

 

The available output ECG formats include: aECG HL7 FDA XML, AMPS binary ECG, ISHNE, SCP, MIT.

 

Demographic information

To be compliant with the FDA HL7 xml format the following demographic information must be included in each XML file:

 

Study Identifier (Protocol ID)
Site ID
Subject ID
Date and Time of the Recording
